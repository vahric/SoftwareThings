We will install single node RabbitMQ for vCloud Director to use CSE or some other stuff

Sure you have updated os

yum update

Disable Firewall and selinux

systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld

setenforce 0

Also disable from selinux conf file too ! 

Why we are disabling selinux and firewall
Actually this is for cluster ....
Port Access

SELinux, and similar mechanisms may prevent RabbitMQ from binding to a port. When that happens, RabbitMQ will fail to start. Firewalls can prevent nodes and CLI tools from communicating with each other. Make sure the following ports can be opened:

    4369: epmd, a peer discovery service used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools
    5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 clients without and with TLS
    25672: used for inter-node and CLI tools communication (Erlang distribution server port) and is allocated from a dynamic range (limited to a single port by default, computed as AMQP port + 20000). Unless external connections on these ports are really necessary (e.g. the cluster uses federation or CLI tools are used on machines outside the subnet), these ports should not be publicly exposed. See networking guide for details.
    35672-35682: used by CLI tools (Erlang distribution client ports) for communication with nodes and is allocated from a dynamic range (computed as server distribution port + 10000 through server distribution port + 10010). See networking guide for details.
    15672: HTTP API clients, management UI and rabbitmqadmin (only if the management plugin is enabled)
    61613, 61614: STOMP clients without and with TLS (only if the STOMP plugin is enabled)
    1883, 8883: (MQTT clients without and with TLS, if the MQTT plugin is enabled
    15674: STOMP-over-WebSockets clients (only if the Web STOMP plugin is enabled)
    15675: MQTT-over-WebSockets clients (only if the Web MQTT plugin is enabled)


Set hostname if you did not !

hostnamectl set-hostname <name>

We will need EPEL , What is EPEL ?

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#What_is_Extra_Packages_for_Enterprise_Linux_.28or_EPEL.29.3F

Install EPEL

yum install epel-release -y

No need erlang because Rabbtimq will install its dependency, Install Rabbitmq on each node

yum install rabbitmq-server -y

Check status for me nothing started yet
[root@vcdrabbitmq ~]# rabbitmqctl status
Status of node rabbit@vcdrabbitmq ...
Error: unable to connect to node rabbit@vcdrabbitmq: nodedown

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

attempted to contact: [rabbit@vcdrabbitmq]

rabbit@vcdrabbitmq:
  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on vcdrabbitmq
  * epmd reports: node 'rabbit' not running at all
                  no other nodes on vcdrabbitmq
  * suggestion: start the node

current node details:
- node name: rabbitmqctl1823@vcdrabbitmq
- home dir: /var/lib/rabbitmq
- cookie hash: opXouxGdLRoJG0uP9CEQiA==

Run RabbitMQ and enable servers for next time 

systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
systemctl enable rabbitmq-server

Check status again for running or not ! 

rabbitmqctl status

Activate GUI for Management and Monitor

rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

Then restart because of related service run ...

systemctl restart rabbitmq-server

To access webmanagement and default username and pass are (guest/guest)
http://<ip>:15672/

To see what other plugins are installed or installable execute command below

rabbitmq-plugins list

To Create User

rabbitmqctl add_user vcdrabbit password_for_admini
Creating user "vcdrabbit" ...
...done.

To Assign Role to User

rabbitmqctl set_user_tags vcdrabbit administrator
Setting tags for user "vcdrabbit" to [administrator] ...
...done.

To Set Permissons

rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / vcdrabbit ".*" ".*" ".*"
Setting permissions for user "vcdrabbit" in vhost "/" ...
...done.

Dont forget to delete guest

rabbitmqctl delete_user guest
