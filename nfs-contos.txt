Install NFS Server

Install required packages ...

yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib -y
yum install net-tools -y

if you will use xfs check such packages are installed or not
yum install xfsprogs

Activate for startup

systemctl start nfs
systemctl enable nfs

For NFSv2 and NFSv3 we will need rpcbind and nfs-lock, actually when you start nfs they should start together

You can check it like below 

systemctl status rpcbind
systemctl status nfs-lock


Export something via NFS

vi /etc/exports

/path_on_server           10.10.0.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

Explanation : 

rw : read/write
sync: you are sure that data is written
no_subtree_check : if whole volume exported use like this
no_root_squash : if shared file need to be onwned by root otherwise remote root user will saved as nobody


After each update of exports file execute command below 

exportfs -a

On Client Site

mount -t nfs ip_of_nfs_server:/path/exported/onfsserver/ /path/on/localhost 

On Client Site fstab

ip_of_nfs_server:/path/exported/onfsserver/  /client/mount/point   nfs      auto,noatime,nolock,bg,nfsvers=3,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0
ip_of_nfs_server:/path/exported/onfsserver/  /client/mount/point   nfs      rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr

Mount Options : https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/s1-nfs-client-config-options.html

Other Informations : 

Net-Tools

netstat -i

NFS Stat

nfsstat -m
*You can see the NFS version

NFS Config Path 

/etc/sysconfig/nfs

Disable NFSv2 and NFSv3 for NFSv4 only (Not required just for information, idea)

Replace the related line with below

RPCNFSDARGS="-N 2 -N 3 -U"

Disable Other Services which will be not needed anymore for nfs

systemctl mask --now rpc-statd.service rpcbind.service rpcbind.socket

And need to restart nfs

systemctl restart nfs
