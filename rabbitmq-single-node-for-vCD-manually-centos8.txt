We will install single node RabbitMQ for vCloud Director to use CSE or some other things

Sure you have updated os

dnf check-update
dnf update

Disable Firewall and selinux

systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld

setenforce 0

Also disable from selinux conf file too ! 
vi /etc/selinux/config --> SELINUX=disabled

Why we are disabling selinux and firewall
Actually this is for cluster ....
Port Access

SELinux, and similar mechanisms may prevent RabbitMQ from binding to a port. When that happens, RabbitMQ will fail to start. Firewalls can prevent nodes and CLI tools from communicating with each other. Make sure the following ports can be opened:

    4369: epmd, a peer discovery service used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools
    5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 clients without and with TLS
    25672: used for inter-node and CLI tools communication (Erlang distribution server port) and is allocated from a dynamic range (limited to a single port by default, computed as AMQP port + 20000). Unless external connections on these ports are really necessary (e.g. the cluster uses federation or CLI tools are used on machines outside the subnet), these ports should not be publicly exposed. See networking guide for details.
    35672-35682: used by CLI tools (Erlang distribution client ports) for communication with nodes and is allocated from a dynamic range (computed as server distribution port + 10000 through server distribution port + 10010). See networking guide for details.
    15672: HTTP API clients, management UI and rabbitmqadmin (only if the management plugin is enabled)
    61613, 61614: STOMP clients without and with TLS (only if the STOMP plugin is enabled)
    1883, 8883: (MQTT clients without and with TLS, if the MQTT plugin is enabled
    15674: STOMP-over-WebSockets clients (only if the Web STOMP plugin is enabled)
    15675: MQTT-over-WebSockets clients (only if the Web MQTT plugin is enabled)


Set hostname if you did not !

hostnamectl set-hostname <name>

To see it use hostnamectl status

We need EPEL and Install EPEL

dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

No need erlang because Rabbtimq will install its dependency

Download specific version of RabbitMQ from bintray.com
For example VMware said that 3.7.9 and 3.8.2 then i used https://bintray.com/rabbitmq/all/rabbitmq-server/3.8.2 to download
Downloaded rabbitmq-server-3.8.2-1.el8.noarch.rpm and installed it 

dnf install -y /tmp/rabbitmq-server-3.8.2-1.el8.noarch.rpm 

Check status for me nothing started yet
[root@vcdrabbitmq ~]# rabbitmqctl status
Status of node rabbit@vcdrabbitmq ...
Error: unable to connect to node rabbit@vcdrabbitmq: nodedown

systemctl enable --now rabbitmq-server

Activate GUI for Management and Monitor

rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

Check Status 

rabbitmqctl status


Not : Centos 8 local configuration file is looks like changed, before i was using /etc/environment but right now its /etc/locale.conf 
LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8
Use "locale" to get all settings ...

To access webmanagement and default username and pass are (guest/guest)
http://<ip>:15672/

To see what other plugins are installed or installable execute command below

rabbitmq-plugins list

To Create User

rabbitmqctl add_user vcdrabbit password_for_admini
Creating user "vcdrabbit" ...
...done.

To Assign Role to User

rabbitmqctl set_user_tags vcdrabbit administrator
Setting tags for user "vcdrabbit" to [administrator] ...
...done.

To Set Permissons

rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / vcdrabbit ".*" ".*" ".*"
Setting permissions for user "vcdrabbit" in vhost "/" ...
...done.

Dont forget to delete guest

rabbitmqctl delete_user guest

Be aware about files size limits ...

Default there is no "Config file(s): (none)" i saw ....
systemctl status rabbitmq-server
