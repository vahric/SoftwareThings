Rabbitmq not like other distributed systems need a leader or slaves , all nodes are in a RabbitMQ cluster are equal peers, no any special nodes.

All cli tools or http api calls could do any of cluster member.

erlang-cookie is a way of auth nodes when join to rabbitmq cluster, to learn more https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#erlang-cookie 

Clients always connect to one node in time
With queue mirroring you can replicat queues to all nodes
Also some of nodes can run as a non-mirrored queue node , which is accept all requet and redirect requests transparently to queue owner node

Many node failure handling supported by Rabbitmq , its include wan too !

For metric and statitics rabbitmq have management plugin

When shutdown disc only rabbitmq nodes then next start they will start and sycn the lates info

if stopping node is the latest one then start time nothing need to be sync

When shutdown all cluster , last node which is stopped should be up first

Sometime last cluster node couldn't be bring online then you should use forget_cluster_node with rabbitmqctl
For example rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node rabbit@<alivenode1>
Also force_boot there but its another story

To remove one of node from cluster

[root@cassandra2 ~]# rabbitmqctl stop_app
Stopping node rabbit@cassandra2 ...
...done.
[root@cassandra2 ~]# rabbitmqctl reset
Resetting node rabbit@cassandra2 ...
...done.
[root@cassandra2 ~]# rabbitmqctl start_app
Starting node rabbit@cassandra2 ...
...done.

There is no any cassandra2 node anymore

For more https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#overview

[root@cassandra1 ~]# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit@cassandra1 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@cassandra1,rabbit@cassandra3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@cassandra3,rabbit@cassandra1]},
 {cluster_name,<<"rabbit@cassandra3">>},
 {partitions,[]}]
...done.

rabbtimq config file 

/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config

rabbirmq log files

/var/log/rabbitmq/

To enable guest user access from internet
Default only guest user can access from localhost

this is before config 

   %% Uncomment the following line if you want to allow access to the
   %% guest user from anywhere on the network.
   %% {loopback_users, []},

This is after config
