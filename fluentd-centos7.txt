Install Fluentd

First to be sure you do not have any time issue
On Centos7 we will use Chrony

yum -y install chrony 
systemctl enable chronyd && systemctl start chronyd && systemctl status chronyd

[root@fluend01 ~]# chronyc tracking
Reference ID    : C18C6428 (samur.ulak.net.tr)
Stratum         : 3
Ref time (UTC)  : Sat Dec 21 07:36:22 2019
System time     : 0.000000000 seconds fast of NTP time
Last offset     : +1.665222883 seconds
RMS offset      : 1.665222883 seconds
Frequency       : 0.000 ppm slow
Residual freq   : +50.860 ppm
Skew            : 1000000.000 ppm
Root delay      : 0.113110624 seconds
Root dispersion : 2.159039974 seconds
Update interval : 0.0 seconds
Leap status     : Normal

Reference ID – the reference ID and name to which the computer is currently synced.
Stratum – number of hops to a computer with an attached reference clock.
Ref time – this is the UTC time at which the last measurement from the reference source was made.
System time – delay of system clock from synchronized server.
Last offset – estimated offset of the last clock update.
RMS offset – long term average of the offset value.
Frequency – this is the rate by which the system’s clock would be wrong if chronyd is not correcting it. It is provided in ppm (parts per million).
Residual freq – residual frequency indicated the difference between the measurements from reference source and the frequency currently being used.
Skew – estimated error bound of the frequency.
Root delay – total of the network path delays to the stratum computer, from which the computer is being synced.
Leap status – this is the leap status which can have one of the following values – normal, insert second, delete second or not synchronized.

[root@fluend01 ~]# chronyc sources

Then modify file limits on linux, add lines below end of the file /etc/security/limits.conf but do not reboot because we will modify system parameters too

root soft nofile 65536
root hard nofile 65536
* soft nofile 65536
* hard nofile 65536

Disable firewalld and selinux

systemctl stop firewalld;systemctl disable firewalld
sed -i 's/enforcing/disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config /etc/selinux/config

Add lines below end of the /etc/sysctl.conf file 

net.core.somaxconn = 1024
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 12582912 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 12582912 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10240 65535

to more adjustment and netflix lover the go this link https://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/how-netflix-tunes-ec2-instances-for-performance 

Now time to reboot 

[root@fluend01 ~]# reboot

Now time to install Fluentd or td-agent
*You can find out different via this link https://www.fluentd.org/faqs

Execute Command Below 

curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent2.5.sh | sh

Message from Flentd : Installation completed. Happy Logging! :D :))))

Activate and run td-agent
