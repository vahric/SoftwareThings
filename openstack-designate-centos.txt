Designate is Openstack DNS-as-a-Service solution (multi-tenant)

To install designate we will need keystone is installed and ready to use.

Generally in openstack all services like designate,nova,magnum have one user and this user have admin role under service project.
Service project is not must but you can create and use different project names but its good practice to do it. 
https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/admin/cli-keystone-manage-services.html

To create service

Execute "source keystonerc_admin"

Create service project if its not available 

openstack project create service --domain default

Create desigate service user

openstack user create --domain default --project service --password-prompt designate

Set admin role to designate user

openstack role add --project service --user designate admin

Designate adında bir servis yaratıyoruz

openstack service create --name designate --description "DNS" dns

Create endpoint for designate

openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne dns public http://10.110.220.1:9001/
openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne dns admin  http://10.110.220.1:9001/
openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne dns internal http://10.110.220.1:9001/

Create database and set permissions 

CREATE DATABASE designate CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON designate.* TO 'designate'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'DESIGNATE_DBPASS';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON designate.* TO 'designate'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'DESIGNATE_DBPASS';
FLUSH PRIVILAGES;
EXIT

Install designate packages

First explain little designate components ; 

designate-api : Known REST API, talk with designate-centeral via RPC
designate-centeral : Manage all zone and record create,update,delete operations and work with designate-pool-manager for interact external DNS servers
designate-producer : Manage periodic tasks
designate-worker : Get works from producer and execute it
designate-mdns : A small DNS server work like proxy and interact with customer facing dns servers. Also can pull
designate-agent : Some DNS Servers need something execute locally, its help to do it
designate-pool-manager : Ensure external DNS servers are sync
designate-sink : Listen nova and neutron events 
Customer Facing DNS Servers : Serve DNS request to end users.

*Not:With Centos and repo what i added failed with some service and i used -nodeps to bypass, and such services below is not installed , fyi.
Yum Install Designate Option 1

yum install openstack-designate\*
**To see whats inside ! 
yum list openstack-designate\*

 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
 You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest


Yum Install Option 2

yum install openstack-designate-*

Yum Install Option 3 (Executed This)

yum --enablerepo=centos-openstack-train,epel -y install openstack-designate-api openstack-designate-central openstack-designate-worker openstack-designate-producer openstack-designate-mdns python-designateclient

Install Customer Facing DNS Server

yum install bind bind-utils -y

Create rndc secret key 

rndc-confgen -a -k designate -c /etc/designate/rndc.key -r /dev/urandom


Edit named.conf
add this line before options ...
include "/etc/designate/rndc.key";

under options

allow-new-zones yes;
request-ixfr no;
recursion no;
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
allow-query { 127.0.0.1; };

controls {
  inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
    allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "designate"; };
};

Then change file permissions

chown named:designate /etc/designate/rndc.key 
chmod 640 /etc/designate/rndc.key

systemctl enable named;systemctl start named

*To test you can run bind on where designate is installed or different server/vm.
*Also test for rndc and bind relation on controller node to everything run correctly.

Now time to configure DNS Pool to describe ns,master and customer facing dns servers 
Create and modify pools.yaml

vi /etc/designate/pools.yaml

  # creation and the only way will to change it will be to delete it
  # (and all zones associated with it) and recreate it.

  # List out the NS records for zones hosted within this pool
  # This should be a record that is created outside of designate, that
  # points to the public IP of the controller node.
  ns_records:

      priority: 1

  # List out the nameservers for this pool. These are the actual BIND servers.
  # We use these to verify changes have propagated to all nameservers.
  nameservers:

  # List out the targets for this pool. For BIND there will be one
  # entry for each BIND server, as we have to run rndc command on each server
  targets:
    - type: bind9
      description: BIND9 Server 1

      # List out the designate-mdns servers from which BIND servers should
      # request zone transfers (AXFRs) from.
      # This should be the IP of the controller node.
      # If you have multiple controllers you can add multiple masters
      # by running designate-mdns on them, and adding them here.
      masters:
        - host: 127.0.0.1
          port: 5354

chmod 640 /etc/designate/pools.yaml 
chgrp designate /etc/designate/pools.yaml
